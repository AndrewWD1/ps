### Critical theorems for understanding and classifying finite groups

Sylow's Theorems are a few closely related results in the theory of groups. They concern "Sylow $p$-subgroups" (defined below) and are usually presented in three parts:

1. Existence.
2. Relation between Sylow $p$-subgroups. (conjugacy)
3. Multiplicity. (how many there are)

Sylow Theorems are prowerful because they are (taken together) one of the few theorems we have to know whether subgroups of certain size exist in arbitrary groups. So, for instance given a group $G$ it may be simple to examine it to see what its subgroups are (though even this gets hard with larger and larger groups.) But if the only information about your group was that $|G| = n,$ then you can't simply look at what subgroups it has, you are in the dark. This is where Sylow's Theorems can come into play, becuase they give you the ability to say "I know $G$ must have a subgroup of order $p^a$" and furthemore you might be able to say exactly how many such subgroups your group $G$ has.
